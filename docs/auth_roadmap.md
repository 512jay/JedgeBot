# JedgeBot Authentication System: Future Enhancements Roadmap

This document outlines potential future upgrades and enhancements to the authentication system used in JedgeBot. While the current system is secure and well-tested, the following ideas represent next-level improvements in UX, security, and scalability.

---

## üîê 1. Security & Best Practices

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rate limiting** | Protect login and reset-password endpoints from brute-force attacks using tools like `slowapi` or `limiter`. |
| **Account lockout** | Temporarily lock accounts after multiple failed login attempts. |
| **Bcrypt tuning** | Monitor bcrypt cost factor (e.g., `12`) and adjust based on hardware performance and threat models. |
| **Refresh token rotation** | Improve JWT handling with refresh token reuse detection and rotation. |
| **Secure HTTP-only cookies** | Ensure tokens are stored with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` flags. |
| **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** | Add optional TOTP or email-based verification for extra protection. |

## üë• 2. User Experience (UX) Improvements

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Show/hide password toggle** | Improve accessibility and usability for password fields. |
| **Live password strength feedback** | Use real-time validation to guide user to create strong passwords. |
| **Username or email login** | Allow login using either a username or an email. |
| **Account suspension message** | Communicate clearly when a login is blocked for moderation reasons. |
| **Magic login links** | Allow passwordless login using a secure link sent via email. |

## ‚úâÔ∏è 3. Email Communication Flow

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Verification reminders** | Periodic reminder email for users who registered but didn‚Äôt verify. |
| **Email change workflow** | Secure process to update user email with notifications to old and new addresses. |
| **Email tracking & delivery status** | Use webhooks (e.g., SendGrid) to track bounces and opens for deliverability. |

---

## üß™ 4. Testing, Logging, & Observability

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Test coverage for verification/resend/reset flows** | Add more integration tests around newly added routes and edge cases. |
| **Log failed login attempts** | Track login failures with IP/user-agent info for auditability. |
| **Audit trail** | Track user account events like login, email changes, role changes. |
| **Structured logging** | JSON-based logs for easier parsing and analysis in production. |

---

## üèÅ 5. Scalability & Architecture

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **UUID everywhere** | All user/account identifiers are UUIDs instead of autoincrement integers. |
| **Centralized role-based access control** | Centralize RBAC logic to simplify permission auditing. |
| **Admin dashboard for user management** | Ban, activate, reset accounts from a GUI instead of raw DB access. |
| **Microservice auth** | If scaling JedgeBot to SaaS, extract auth into its own service. |

## ‚úÖ Recommended Next Steps

- [ ] Add resend-verification button to unverified login flow (‚úÖ Done)
- [ ] Write tests for token expiration and resend verification flow
- [ ] Implement user audit logs
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware (e.g. `slowapi`)
- [ ] Consider adding Magic Login as optional login method

This roadmap will evolve as JedgeBot grows. Focus on what supports the next most valuable user-facing feature.
