## 🌟 Structure Strategy

### ✅ Feature-Based Domain Separation
- Auth concerns live in `auth/`
- Profile, roles, and client-manager-enterprise hierarchy live in `users/`
- Brokers are modular and isolated per integration

### ✅ Layered Concerns Within Domains
Each folder contains its own:
- `models.py` → SQLAlchemy data models
- `schemas.py` → Pydantic schemas for validation
- `services.py` → Core business logic
- `queries.py` → Raw DB access logic
- `routes.py` → FastAPI endpoints (when applicable)

### ✅ Shared Config, Utils, and Routing
- `core/` handles environment, startup, and rate-limiting
- `utils/` is home to generic tools (e.g., logging, hashing, token generation)
- `api/` aggregates and registers all FastAPI route groups

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scalable** | Easily extend each domain without restructuring |
| **Clear Ownership** | Each folder reflects a real-world concern (auth, brokers, users) |
| **Testable** | Isolated logic means easier unit and integration testing |
| **Collaborator-Friendly** | Future devs can find and understand what each folder is doing |
| **Microservice-Ready** | Domains like `auth/` or `brokers/` can later become standalone services |
| **Fast Navigation** | No more digging through deep `data/database/auth` paths |

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Continue moving business-related models (e.g., `UserProfile`) to `users/`
- Update route logic to use domain-specific FastAPI routers
- Confirm `alembic` is pointed at the correct DB models

---

## 📝 Notes

This structure reflects a hybrid approach combining **domain-driven design**, **separation of concerns**, and **FastAPI-friendly layout**. It is designed to grow with the JedgeBot project as it supports:
- Role-based dashboards
- Multi-broker accounts
- Long-term enterprise features
