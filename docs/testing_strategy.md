# 🚀 Lightweight Test Strategy for JedgeBot

## 1️⃣ Set Up Poetry for Testing
Since JedgeBot uses Poetry, install `pytest` and `pytest-bdd` for testing:

```sh
poetry add --dev pytest pytest-bdd
```

This enables both **unit testing** and **behavior-driven testing (BDD)**.

---

## 2️⃣ Define What to Test
We'll focus on **three key areas**:

| **Test Type**    | **What We’re Testing** | **Tool Used** |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| ✅ **Unit Tests** (TDD) | Core trading logic (order execution, pricing calculations) | `pytest` |
| ✅ **API Integration Tests** | Ensure broker API calls work correctly | `pytest` (with mocks) |
| 🔹 **Behavior-Driven Tests** (BDD) | End-to-end trade execution | `pytest-bdd` |

---

## 3️⃣ Write Unit Tests for Core Trading Logic
### 📌 Example: Test `place_buy_write_order` in `order_manager.py`
```python
import pytest
from trading.order_manager import place_buy_write_order

def test_buy_write_order():
    """Test that a buy-write order executes correctly."""
    result = place_buy_write_order("SPY", 100, strike_price=490)
    assert result["status"] == "submitted"
    assert result["symbol"] == "SPY"
    assert result["quantity"] == 100
```

---

## 4️⃣ Mock API Calls for Broker Integration
Avoid live broker API calls by mocking them.

### 📌 Example: Mocking IBKR API Calls
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from trading.ibkr_client import IBKRClient

@pytest.fixture
def mock_ibkr():
    ibkr = IBKRClient()
    ibkr.place_order = MagicMock(return_value={"status": "submitted"})
    return ibkr

def test_ibkr_order(mock_ibkr):
    """Ensure IBKR order submission works as expected."""
    response = mock_ibkr.place_order("SPY", "BUY", 100)
    assert response["status"] == "submitted"
```

---

## 5️⃣ Add a Simple BDD Test for Order Execution
Use BDD for **end-to-end scenarios** like trade execution.

### 📌 Step 1: Write a Gherkin Feature File (`features/trading.feature`)
```gherkin
Feature: Trading Execution

  Scenario: Submit a Covered Call Order
    Given the user selects SPY
    When they execute a buy-write strategy
    Then the order should be placed successfully
```

### 📌 Step 2: Implement Step Definitions (`test_trading.py`)
```python
from pytest_bdd import scenarios, given, when, then
from trading.order_manager import place_buy_write_order

scenarios("features/trading.feature")

@given("the user selects SPY")
def select_stock():
    return "SPY"

@when("they execute a buy-write strategy")
def execute_strategy(select_stock):
    return place_buy_write_order(select_stock, 100, strike_price=490)

@then("the order should be placed successfully")
def verify_order(execute_strategy):
    assert execute_strategy["status"] == "submitted"
```

### 📌 Step 3: Run the Tests
```sh
poetry run pytest
```

---

## 6️⃣ Automate Tests (Optional)
Prevent **manual test execution** by automating them using **GitHub Actions**.

### 📌 GitHub Actions Example (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`)
```yaml
name: Run Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
      - run: pip install poetry
      - run: poetry install
      - run: poetry run pytest
```

---

## 🎯 Final Takeaway: Keep It Lean & Efficient
✅ **Use `pytest` for core logic (TDD)** – orders, risk checks, and pricing.  
✅ **Mock broker APIs** to avoid real trades during testing.  
✅ **Use `pytest-bdd` for key workflows** (like trade execution).  
✅ **Automate tests** with GitHub Actions (optional).  

This strategy keeps testing **lightweight** while ensuring JedgeBot is **robust and reliable**. 🚀
