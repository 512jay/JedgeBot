# Future Enhancements: Market Research & Analysis

## Overview
As JedgeBot evolves, we may explore additional features to enhance market research and analysis. While the core focus remains on trade execution and broker integration, integrating **OpenBB** or other research tools could provide valuable insights for users who are still exploring trading strategies before executing trades.

## Potential Integration: OpenBB
**OpenBB** is an open-source investment research platform that provides market data, fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and options analytics.

### Possible Use Cases
- **Market Screening:** Identify potential stocks and options contracts before execution.
- **Options Analytics:** Retrieve options chains, implied volatility, Greeks, and open interest data.
- **Technical Analysis:** Utilize indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands to refine strategies.
- **Backtesting & Research:** Leverage OpenBB’s data sources to evaluate past performance of trading strategies.
- **Crypto & Forex Data:** Supplement trading decisions with data from alternative markets.

## Implementation Considerations
- OpenBB would be an **optional feature**, ensuring JedgeBot remains lightweight and focused on execution.
- Data retrieval should be modular, potentially under `integrations/openbb/` or `data_sources/openbb.py`.
- Any integration must align with the broader roadmap, ensuring it does not distract from core development goals.

## Next Steps
- **Short Term:** Research feasibility and potential benefits of OpenBB within JedgeBot.
- **Long Term:** Implement an optional research module for users who wish to analyze markets before executing trades.

This enhancement remains a **future consideration** and will not impact the current milestones for trade execution and broker integration.
